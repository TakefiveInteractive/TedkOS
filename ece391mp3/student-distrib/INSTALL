ECE391 MP3 - Operating System Project
=====================================

To get this skeleton OS running on QEMU, you must do the following steps:

"make dep"
"sudo make"

to build the OS (it is called bootimg) and the QEMU disk image (mp3.img)

You can then follow the instructions in Appendix G to setup your
debug.bat batch script.

If you would like to run MP3 without having to connect gdb (When you are done
and have removed all your bugs for example), you can duplicate the debug.bat
batch script and remove the -s and -S options in the QEMU command.  This is 
will stop QEMU from waiting for GDB to connect.

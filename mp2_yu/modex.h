/*
 * NOTES
 *
 * Mode X is an (originally) undocumented variant of mode 13h, the first
 * IBM 256-color graphics mode.  Each pixel uses a single byte to specify
 * one of the 256 possible colors, and a palette is used to map each color
 * into an 18-bit space (6-bit red, green, and blue intensities).
 *
 * The map from memory as seen by the host processor is non-linear, and was
 * originally designed to allow high-performance hardware designs.  Video
 * memory is in words of 32 bits, and is divided into four planes.  In mode
 * X, groups of four pixels are mapped into a single host address and written
 * individually or together by setting a bit mask of planes to be written
 * (a VGA register).
 *
 * each four pixels counts as one (one-byte) address ->
 * 0123012301230123012301230123012301230123012301230123012301230123
 *
 * The mapping is more contorted than with mode 13h, but allows use of
 * graphics tricks such as double-buffering.
 *
 * The design here is strongly influenced by the fact that we are running
 * in a virtual machine in which writes to video memory are exorbitantly
 * expensive.  In particular, writing a chunk of 16kB with a single x86
 * instruction (REP MOVSB) is much faster than writing two hundred bytes
 * with many instructions.
 *
 * That said, the design is not unreasonable, and is only slightly different
 * than was (and is) often used today.
 *
 * Double-buffering uses two sections of memory to allow a program to
 * draw the next screen to be displayed without having the partially drawn
 * screen visible on the monitor (which causes flicker).  When the drawing
 * is complete, the video adapter is told to display the new screen instead
 * of the old one, and the memory used for the old screen is then used to
 * draw a third screen, the video adapter is switched back, and the process
 * starts again.
 *
 * In our variant of double-buffering, we use non-video memory as the
 * scratch pad, copy the drawn screen as a whole into one of two buffers
 * in video memory, and switch the picture between the two buffers.  The
 * cost of the copy is negligible; the cost of writing to video memory
 * instead is quite high (under most virtual machines).
 *
 * In order to reduce drawing time, we reuse most of the screen data between
 * video frames.  New data are drawn only when the viewing window moves
 * within a logical space defined by the program.  For example, if this
 * window shifts one pixel to the left, only the left border of the screen
 * is drawn.  Other data are left untouched in most cases.

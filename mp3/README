ECE391 MP3 - Package contents
================================

createfs
    This program takes a flat source directory (i.e. no subdirectories
    in the source directory) and creates a filesystem image in the
    format specified for this MP.  Run it with no parameters to see
    usage.

elfconvert
    This program takes a 32-bit ELF (Executable and Linking Format) file
    - the standard executable type on Linux - and converts it to the
    executable format specified for this MP.  The output filename is
    <exename>.converted.

fish/
	This directory contains the source for the fish animation program.
	It can be compiled two ways - one for your operating system, and one
	for Linux using an emulation layer.  The Makefile is currently set
	up to build "fish" for your operating system using the elfconvert
	utility described above.  If you want to build a Linux version, do
	"make fish_emulated".  You can then run fish_emulated as superuser
	at a standard Linux console, and you should see the fish animation.

fsdir/
	This is the directory from which your filesystem image was created.
	It contains versions of cat, fish, grep, hello, ls, and shell, as
	well as the frame0.txt and frame1.txt files that fish needs to run.
	If you want to change files in your OS's filesystem, modify this
	directory and then run the "createfs" utility on it to create a new
	filesystem image.

	The only problem with this directory is that
	there is no "rtc" device file.  This is due to limitations with the
	Samba network filesystem that your home directories are shared from.
	If you wish to include the "rtc" device file in this directory (to
	make the fish animation work properly), you must copy the entire
	"fsdir" directory to a Linux filesystem (say, in /home/user).  Then,
	as root, run "mknod /home/user/fsdir/rtc c 10 61".  Then you can run
	the "createfs" utility on /home/user/fsdir to obtain a new
	filesystem image that contains the rtc device file.

README
    This file.

student-distrib/
    This is the directory that contains the source code for your
    operating system.  Currently, a skeleton is provided that will build
    and boot you into protected mode, printing out various boot
    parameters.  Read the INSTALL file in that directory for
    instructions on how to set up the bootloader to boot this OS.

syscalls/
    This directory contains a basic system call library that is used by
    the utility programs such as cat, grep, ls, etc.  The library
    provides a C interface to the system calls, much like the C library
    (libc) provides on a real Linux/Unix system.  A few support
    functions have also been written (things like strlen, strcpy, etc.)
    that are used by the utility programs.  The Makefile is set up to
	build these programs for your OS.

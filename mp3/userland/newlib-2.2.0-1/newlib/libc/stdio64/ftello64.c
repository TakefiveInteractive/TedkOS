FUNCTION
<<ftello64>>---return position in a stream or file

INDEX
	ftello64
INDEX
	_ftello64_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	_off64_t ftello64(FILE *<[fp]>);
	_off64_t _ftello64_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	_off64_t ftello64(<[fp]>)
	FILE *<[fp]>;

	_off64_t _ftello64_r(<[ptr]>, <[fp]>)
	struct _reent *<[ptr]>;
	FILE *<[fp]>;

DESCRIPTION
Objects of type <<FILE>> can have a ``position'' that records how much
of the file your program has already read.  Many of the <<stdio>> functions
depend on this position, and many change it as a side effect.

The result of <<ftello64>> is the current position for a large file
identified by <[fp]>.  If you record this result, you can later
use it with <<fseeko64>> to return the file to this
position.  The difference between <<ftello>> and <<ftello64>> is that
<<ftello>> returns <<off_t>> and <<ftello64>> is designed to work
for large files (>2GB) and returns <<_off64_t>>.

In the current implementation, <<ftello64>> simply uses a character
count to represent the file position; this is the same number that
would be recorded by <<fgetpos64>>.

The function exists only if the __LARGE64_FILES flag is defined.
An error occurs if the <[fp]> was not opened via <<fopen64>>.

RETURNS
<<ftello64>> returns the file position, if possible.  If it cannot do
this, it returns <<-1>>.  Failure occurs on streams that do not support
positioning or not opened via <<fopen64>>; the global <<errno>> indicates
this condition with the value <<ESPIPE>>.

PORTABILITY
<<ftello64>> is a glibc extension.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.

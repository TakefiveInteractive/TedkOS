@node Reentrancy
@chapter Reentrancy Properties of @code{libm}

@cindex reentrancy
@cindex @code{matherr} and reentrancy
When a libm function detects an exceptional case, @code{errno} may be
set, the @code{matherr} function may be called, and a error message 
may be written to the standard error stream.  This behavior may not
be reentrant.

@c The exact behavior depends on the currently selected error handling 
@c mode (IEEE, POSIX, X/Open, or SVID).

With reentrant C libraries like the Red Hat newlib C library, @code{errno} is
a macro which expands to the per-thread error value.  This makes it thread
safe.

When the user provides his own @code{matherr} function it must be
reentrant for the math library as a whole to be reentrant.

In normal debugged programs, there are usually no math subroutine
errors---and therefore no assignments to @code{errno} and no @code{matherr}
calls; in that situation, the math functions behave reentrantly.

@node Long Double Functions
@chapter The long double function support of @code{libm}
Currently, the full set of long double math functions is only provided
on platforms where long double equals double.
For such platforms, the long double math functions are implemented as calls to the double versions.

			 Newlib Maintainers


		      Blanket Write Privileges

The official maintainers of newlib:

Jeff Johnston			jjohnstn@redhat.com
Corinna Vinschen		corinna@vinschen.de


		     Various Domain Maintainers

This is a list of maintainers who look after specific domains of newlib.
Individuals who maintain parts of newlib need approval to check in changes
outside of the immediate domain that they maintain.

If there is no maintainer for a given domain then the responsibility
falls to the head maintainers.

If there are several maintainers for a given domain then
responsibility falls to the first maintainer.  The first maintainer is
free to devolve that responsibility among the other maintainers.

			CPU Port Maintainers	(CPU alphabetical order)

well as cpu-specific portions of the build system, without approval.

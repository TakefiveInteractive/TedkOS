====== Here we state the source codes of others we cited ======

Boost C++ libraries:
	We did NOT rely on it to implement critical aspects of the operating system,
		or any aspect of the operating system that we are required to learn in this course.

	We use it ONLY to simplify C++ programming.

====== A note on the binary files provided in fsdir ======

Some of the binaries do NOT come with source codes.

Those binaries may be compiled using others' source codes,

	We did NOT rely on them to implement critical aspects of the operating system.
		or any aspect of the operating system that we are required to learn in this course.

for example,
	1. we plan to compile several games, but it's certainly
	not possible for us to write all the codes of the
	user-side programs. For example, We relied on newlib-2.2.0-1
	so that a user program can use libm (math.h) library.
